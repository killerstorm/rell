RELEASE NOTES 0.10.10 (2022-06-30)

1. Upgrade to Postchain 3.6.0.

2. Tools: multirun.sh --test-chain

Tell multirun.sh which chain(s) to execute with new option --test-chain:

    ./multirun.sh -d rell/src --test rell/config/run.xml --test-chain foo

The new option accepts a comma-separated list of chain names.

3. Language: Old sort syntax removed

The "sort" keyword, which was used to specify sorting in at-expressions, was removed. Now one shall use "@sort" and
"@sort_desc" annotations. (The old syntax produced a deprecation warning in previous versions.)

4. Some bugs fixed.
