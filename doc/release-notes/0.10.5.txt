RELEASE NOTES 0.10.5 (2021-07-17)

A minor update to revert the object attribute expression restrictions added in 0.10.4. The restrictions did not allow
to do any database modifications in such expressions, but turned out that some existing Rell code depended on that
possibility and used it to perform initialization.

In the future, a new way to perform initialization shall be introduced (via a special init operation). Then, database
modifications in object attribute expressions will be prohibited, but they will keep working in the compatibility mode
(when the source code version is 0.10.5 or older).
